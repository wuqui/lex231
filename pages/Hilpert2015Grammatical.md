- “Another domain of English grammar that is currently undergoing change is the domain of modality, specifically the modal auxiliaries. In the most general of terms, the situation is that several of the core modal auxiliaries” (“The Cambridge Handbook of English Corpus Linguistics”, 2015, p. 185)

- “are declining in text frequency (Leech 2003; Mair 2006), while at the same time new quasi-modal elements are undergoing grammaticalization (Krug 2000).” (“The Cambridge Handbook of English Corpus Linguistics”, 2015, p. 186)

- “The result is a dynamic situation that raises a number of questions. For instance, it has been asked why certain forms are in decline whereas others are on the upswing. Is there a relation between these developments, and if so, how do we assign the roles of cause and effect?” (“The Cambridge Handbook of English Corpus Linguistics”, 2015, p. 186)

- “Parallel cross-variety declines are particularly in evidence for the modals would, may, should, must, and shall.” (“The Cambridge Handbook of English Corpus Linguistics”, 2015, p. 186)

	- **The [[Brown Corpus]]**
	  collapsed:: true
		- This corpus was the first computer-readable general corpus of texts prepared for linguistic research on modern English.
		- It was compiled by W. Nelson Francis and Henry Kučera at Brown University in the 1960s.
		- The corpus contains over 1 million words, with 500 samples of 2000+ words each, of running text of edited English prose printed in the United States during the calendar year 1961.
		- The texts cover a variety of genres, including press (reportage, editorial, review), general prose (religion, skills, trades and hobbies, popular lore, belles lettres, biographies, essays, miscellaneous), learned (science), and fiction (general fiction, mystery and detective fiction, science fiction, adventure and Western, romance and love story, humor)​

	- **The [[Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen Corpus]] (LOB Corpus)**
	  collapsed:: true
		- This is a one-million-word collection of British English texts, which was compiled in the 1970s.
		- The corpus was designed to provide a British counterpart to the [Brown Corpus]([[Brown Corpus]]) and uses documents published in the UK in 1961 by British authors.
		- It also consists of 500 samples each comprising about 2000 words in similar genres to the Brown Corpus.
		- Each word in the corpus has been assigned a part-of-speech category​

	- **The [[Freiburg-Brown Corpus]] of American English (Frown Corpus)**
	  collapsed:: true
		- This corpus, along with its counterpart the [[Freiburg-LOB Corpus]] of British English (FLOB), was begun in 1991 to match the [Brown]([[Brown Corpus]]) and [LOB]([[LOB Corpus]]) corpora as closely as possible in size and composition, but representing the language of the early 1990s.
		- Like the original Brown and LOB corpora, Frown contains 500 texts of around 2000 words each, distributed across 15 text categories.
		- The genres covered are the same as in the original Brown and LOB corpora​
		- https://varieng.helsinki.fi/CoRD/corpora/FROWN/basic.html
	- **The [Freiburg-LOB Corpus]([[Freiburg-LOB Corpus]]) of British English (FLOB)**
	  collapsed:: true
		- This corpus is an update of the [LOB corpus]([[LOB Corpus]]) and is part of the ‘Brown family’ of corpora.
		- The work on the compilation of FLOB began in 1991, and the corpus was intended to match the [Brown]([[Brown Corpus]]) and LOB corpora as closely as possible in size and composition, with the only difference being that they represent the language of the early 1990s.
		- F-LOB contains 500 texts of around 2000 words each, distributed across the same 15 text categories as the Brown and LOB corpora.
		- There are two versions of the F-LOB corpus, the original version and a POS-tagged version​

- “Leech examines the possibility that newly grammaticalizing modal forms may be responsible for the observed decline.” (“The Cambridge Handbook of English Corpus Linguistics”, 2015, p. 186)
- “An analysis of forms such as be going to, have to, got to, need to, and several others does not, however, lend credence to this idea. Not all of these forms increase in frequency, and those that do, notably need to and want to, are relatively low in text frequency and hence do not match the declining numbers of core modals such as will or would.” (“The Cambridge Handbook of English Corpus Linguistics”, 2015, p. 186)

- “This is further corroborated by Hilpert (2008: 37), who finds that typical verbal collocates of shall in the British National Corpus are the explicitly” (“The Cambridge Handbook of English Corpus Linguistics”, 2015, p. 186)
- “metalinguistic verbs consider, examine, discuss,andargue. The decline of shall is thus to be seen as a retraction into a highly specific communicative genre.” (“The Cambridge Handbook of English Corpus Linguistics”, 2015, p. 187)
- “In a study that is based on the Time magazine corpus (Davies 2007), Millar (2009) tracks the frequency of the modal auxiliaries in American English press writing. He finds that shall, must,andought are declining between the 1920s and the 2000s, but that interestingly, can, could,and may are undergoing substantial frequency increases and will, might,and should show at least small increases (Millar 2009: 205).” (“The Cambridge Handbook of English Corpus Linguistics”, 2015, p. 187)
- “One explanation for the discrepancies between the tendencies in the Brown family of corpora and in the Time corpus is the composition of the respective corpora. Whereas the Brown corpora represent a balanced set of genres, the Time corpus represents a single text type. To test whether genre differences explain the discrepancies, Millar (2009: 207) compares his Time results against an analysis of the press genres in the Brown and Frown corpora, finding, however, no satisfactory convergence between the two. Millar thus invokes sampling error as an explanation, which is criticized by Leech (2011a), who replicates the results from the Brown family of corpora on the basis of the balanced diachronic mega-corpora COCA and COHA (Davies 2008, 2010). These results leave the frequency increases of can, could,and may in Time in need of an explanation, for which Leech (2011a: 557) suggests a genre-specific style change in journalistic writing.” (“The Cambridge Handbook of English Corpus Linguistics”, 2015, p. 187)
