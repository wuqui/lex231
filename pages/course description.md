- This course in 'English Lexicology and Lexicography' provides an 
  in-depth look into the study of words and dictionaries. It delves into 
  topics such as word formation, meaning and word senses, and lexical 
  variation, emphasizing the role of corpus linguistics in modern 
  lexicography. Students will acquire the skills to analyze English words 
  in different contexts using corpus linguistic data and methods.
- For the practical component of the course, students will work with 
  dictionary resources like Wiktionary and the Oxford English Dictionary 
  (OED), and corpora such as the Corpus of Contemporary American English 
  (COCA) and News on the Web (NOW). They will utilize corpus platforms 
  like english-corpora.org and Sketch Engine, and engage in 
  frequency-based analyses, studying collocations, and creating Word 
  Sketches. A significant part of the course involves hands-on work with 
  data, often in group settings. This allows students to gain experience 
  in applying these methods and tools to lexicological and lexicographical
  research projects.
