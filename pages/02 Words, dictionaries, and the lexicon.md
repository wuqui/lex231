		- > The term ‘dictionary’ is usually restricted to real-world dictionaries that appear in print and online. Dictionaries provide a list of words of whatever language they deal with — in our case, English — and then give a certain amount of information about each of them. Dictionaries tend to have two functions, which may, on occasions, conflict with each other:
			- > to describe the language as it is,
			- > and to provide an influence for establishing and maintaining the standard form of the language.

		- > If we assume that one of *ˈkilometre* and *kiˈlometre* is right (and the other, therefore, wrong), we assume that there is a unique solution to this question of English usage. We assume that it is a question like *Should you drive on the right or on the left in England?* where there is a single solution laid down by law. We assume it is not like *Should I wear jeans to the party tonight?* where the answer may depend on your age, the dress code for the party, how good you think you look in jeans, whether you prefer to be underdressed or overdressed for any occasion, what else you have to wear, the kind of party that is involved, where the party is being held and so on.
		- > Language questions are more often like the jeans queston, and less often like the driving-side question. Whatever answer the person you have asked gives you, there will be somebody else, apparently equally authoritative, who will give you a different answer.

The OED gives a list of such spurious words including *banket* (‘a term in bricklaying’), *David's staff* (‘a navigational instrument) and *sardel*, variously supposed to be a fish (the sardine) or a precious stone.
