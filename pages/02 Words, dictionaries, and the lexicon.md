				- > The term ‘paradigm’ is in general usage, but its usage is often limited. Although paradigm can justafiably be used of any substitution class, it is most often used of substitution classes within the word. Thus the normal use for the term ‘paradigm’ is the kind of substitution class illustrated in ((654a5862-20e5-446c-8836-a4cdb578efad)).

		- What kind of information does the OED provide about their ‘atypical features’?
